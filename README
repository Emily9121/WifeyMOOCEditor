# WifeyMOOC Editor 1.2.0

This is an editor for question files used by Wifeymooc, an App used for language learning, due to how it came to exist, no maintenance is promised even for massive bugs, don't complain to me if it kill your guinea pig or something.

AI Disclosure: 100% of everything was made with AI, sorry, while I have personal ethical concern with the tech, it seemed like the best fitting option for what is essentially
a solution for personal use only (that now happen to be public, but only because I want a git repository lol, I don't expect anyone to care!), given those circumstance,
everything is licencied into  DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE , including the example exercise and it's images.

Changelog:

1.0.0 - Initial public release.

1.1.0 - Initial public re-release after fixed many many issues (whole project re-built from scratch)

1.2.0 - Added the python version to the public repository - Added support for hint in the json file!
