# **üíñ WifeyMOOC Editor üíñ**

Welcome to the WifeyMOOC Editor, a delightful tool designed with love for creating and editing JSON-based quizzes for the WifeyMOOC language learning app\! This editor is my special project to help my amazing wife, Sierra, with her French lessons. It's packed with features to make quiz creation as fun and easy as possible\!  
This editor comes in two fabulous flavors:

1. A super chic desktop application written in **C++/Qt 6**.  
2. A totally cute and portable script written in **Python 3/Tkinter**.

Both versions are designed to be pink, adorable, and incredibly functional\! üíï

## **‚ú® Author's Note & AI Disclosure**

This project was born out of love and for my personal use (to make cute French quizzes for my wife\!). It's now public mostly so I can keep it in a git repository, hehe.  
A little secret: pretty much 100% of this was crafted with the help of AI\! While I have my own thoughts on the tech, it was the perfect tool for a personal project like this. Given these circumstances, everything here is licensed under the **DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE**. That includes all the code, example exercises, and images. Feel free to use it, but please don't complain to me if it turns your cat into a croissant\! ü•ê
